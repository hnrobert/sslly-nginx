## How It Works

`sslly-nginx` is a Go application that runs inside an Nginx Alpine container and manages the Nginx configuration dynamically:

1. **Configuration Monitoring**: Watches `./configs/config.yaml` for changes
2. **Certificate Scanning**: Recursively scans `./ssl` directory for certificate files
3. **Nginx Generation**: Generates Nginx configuration based on port-to-domain mappings
4. **Health Checks**: Verifies Nginx health after each reload
5. **Rollback Protection**: Maintains last working configuration for automatic recovery

## Quick Start

For a quick start & deployment guide, see [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

## Configuration

### Application Configuration

The configuration file (`configs/config.yaml`) maps upstream addresses to domain names. It supports multiple formats:

#### Format 1: Port Only (Default to localhost)

```yaml
# Proxies to 127.0.0.1:port
1234:
  - example.com
  - www.example.com
5678:
  - api.example.com
```

#### Format 2: IP:Port (Proxy to specific IP)

```yaml
# Proxies to 192.168.31.6:1234
192.168.31.6:1234:
  - lan.example.com
  - local.example.com
```

#### Format 3: Hostname:Port

```yaml
# Proxies to remote-server:8080
remote-server:8080:
  - remote.example.com
```

#### Format 4: IPv6 with Brackets

```yaml
# Proxies to IPv6 address 2001:db8::1 port 3000
[2001:db8::1]:3000:
  - ipv6.example.com
```

**Configuration Key Formats:**

- `port` ‚Üí Proxies to `127.0.0.1:port` (default)
- `ip:port` ‚Üí Proxies to `ip:port`
- `hostname:port` ‚Üí Proxies to `hostname:port`
- `[ipv6]:port` ‚Üí Proxies to IPv6 address with brackets

### SSL Certificate Structure

Place SSL certificates in the `ssl/` directory. The application supports the following naming patterns:

1. **Bundle format**: `domain_bundle.crt` and `domain_bundle.key`

   - Example: `example.com_bundle.crt` and `example.com_bundle.key`

2. **Standard format**: `domain.crt` and `domain.key`
   - Example: `example.com.crt` and `example.com.key`

You can organize certificates in subdirectories:

```tree
ssl/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com_bundle.crt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com_bundle.key
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging.example.com.crt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging.example.com.key
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api.example.com.crt
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api.example.com.key
```

**Important Notes**:

- Each domain must have exactly one certificate (no duplicates)
- Both `.crt` and `.key` files must exist
- Certificates are matched by domain name automatically
- **SSL certificates are optional**: If no certificate is found for a domain, the service will proxy HTTP traffic directly
- **HTTPS to HTTP redirect**: If HTTPS is accessed for domains without valid certificates, traffic is redirected to HTTP (301)

### HTTP-Only Mode

If you don't have SSL certificates yet or want to serve some domains over HTTP only:

1. The application will automatically detect missing certificates
2. Domains without certificates will be served over HTTP (no redirect)
3. Domains with certificates will use HTTPS with automatic HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS redirect
4. **HTTPS fallback**: If someone accesses HTTPS for a domain without a valid certificate, they'll be redirected to HTTP with a 301 status
5. You can mix HTTP and HTTPS domains in the same configuration

Example scenario:

```yaml
# config.yaml
1234:
  - secure.example.com # Has certificate ‚Üí HTTPS
  - dev.example.com # No certificate ‚Üí HTTP only
```

## Features in Detail

### Automatic HTTPS Redirect

When SSL certificates are detected:

- All HTTP traffic for domains **with certificates** is automatically redirected to HTTPS
- HTTPS traffic for domains **without certificates** is redirected to HTTP (301) to avoid certificate errors

If no certificates are found for any domain, HTTP traffic is proxied directly to your applications.

### Hot Reload

The application watches for changes in:

- Configuration files (`./configs/config.yaml` or `./configs/config.yml`)
- SSL certificates (`./ssl/**/*`)

When changes are detected:

1. New configuration is generated
2. Nginx configuration is tested
3. If valid, Nginx is reloaded
4. If invalid, the previous working configuration is restored

### Error Handling

- **Initial Startup**:
  - If configuration is invalid, the service stops
  - Missing SSL certificates are **not** an error - service runs in HTTP-only mode
- **Runtime Errors**: If reload fails, the application:
  - Logs detailed error messages
  - Restores the last working configuration
  - Continues running with previous settings

### WebSocket Support

The generated Nginx configuration includes WebSocket support for all proxied applications.

### Advanced Proxy Features

The reverse proxy includes optimized settings for various applications:

- **Large File Upload**: Supports files up to 100MB by default
- **Correct Host Header**: Uses `$host` to preserve the original request hostname (critical for apps like qBittorrent, OnlineJudge)
- **Proxy Headers**: Includes all standard headers:
  - `Host`: Original request hostname (e.g., `torrent.hnrobert.space`)
  - `X-Real-IP`: Client's real IP address
  - `X-Forwarded-For`: Full proxy chain
  - `X-Forwarded-Host`: Original Host header
  - `X-Forwarded-Proto`: Original protocol (http/https)
- **Cookie Security**: Automatically sets Secure flag for cookies when using HTTPS
- **Timeouts**: Configured with 60s timeouts for connect/send/read operations
- **Proxy Buffering**: Optimized buffer settings for better performance

These settings work well with applications like:

- qBittorrent (WebUI)
- Portainer (Docker management)
- Jellyfin (Media streaming)
- Home Assistant (Smart home)
- OnlineJudge (Competitive programming)
- And most other web applications

## FRP Integration

`sslly-nginx` integrates seamlessly with [FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy)](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) to expose your local services through remote servers, enabling secure remote access to your applications from anywhere.

### Key Benefits

- **Secure Remote Access**: Access your local applications from anywhere via HTTPS
- **Custom Domains**: Use your own domain names instead of IP addresses
- **SSL Management**: SSL certificates configured locally for domain-based routing
- **Flexible Port Configuration**: Change HTTP/HTTPS ports to avoid conflicts with FRP

### Quick Setup

1. **Configure Ports**: Modify `docker-compose.yml` to use non-standard ports:

   ```yaml
   environment:
     - SSL_NGINX_HTTP_PORT=9980 # HTTP traffic
     - SSL_NGINX_HTTPS_PORT=9943 # HTTPS traffic
   ```

2. **Setup FRP Client**: Create `frpc.toml`:

   ```toml
   serverAddr = "your-frp-server.com"
   serverPort = 7000
   auth.method = "token"
   auth.token = "your-secure-token"

   # HTTPS proxy - handles SSL/TLS traffic
   [[proxies]]
   name = "sslly-nginx-https"
   type = "https"
   localIP = "127.0.0.1"
   localPort = 9943
   customDomains = ["*.yourdomain.com", "yourdomain.com"]

   # HTTP proxy - handles plain HTTP and auto-redirects
   [[proxies]]
   name = "sslly-nginx-http"
   type = "http"
   localIP = "127.0.0.1"
   localPort = 9980
   customDomains = ["*.yourdomain.com", "yourdomain.com"]
   ```

3. **Start Services**: Run both FRP client and sslly-nginx

For detailed FRP integration guide, see [docs/FRP.md](docs/FRP.md).

## CI/CD Workflows

The project includes three GitHub Actions workflows:

### 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

- **Triggers**: All branch pushes and pull requests
- **Actions**:
  - Build the application
  - Run tests
  - Run linter and format checks
- **No Docker image is built**

### 2. Docker Build Workflow (`docker-build.yml`)

- **Triggers**: Pushes to `main` and `develop` branches
- **Actions**:
  - Run tests
  - Build Docker image
  - Push to `ghcr.io`
- **Tags**:
  - `main` branch ‚Üí `latest` tag
  - `develop` branch ‚Üí `develop` tag

### 3. Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

- **Triggers**:
  - Git tag push (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
  - Manual workflow dispatch
- **Actions**:
  - Create tag (if workflow_dispatch)
  - Run tests
  - Build and push Docker image with version tag
  - Create GitHub release

## Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` is configured with:

- **Network Mode**: `host` - Uses host networking for direct port access
- **Restart Policy**: `on-failure` - Stops on errors, auto-starts on system boot
- **Volumes**:
  - `./configs:/app/configs:ro` - Configuration (read-only)
  - `./ssl:/app/ssl:ro` - SSL certificates (read-only)

### Environment Variables

- `SSL_NGINX_HTTP_PORT` (default: `80`) ‚Äî port Nginx listens for HTTP and redirect to HTTPS
- `SSL_NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` (default: `443`) ‚Äî port Nginx listens for HTTPS

### Viewing Logs

All logs (application + nginx access/error logs) are forwarded to Docker's log collector:

```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View only application logs
docker-compose logs -f sslly-nginx

# View last 100 lines
docker-compose logs --tail=100 sslly-nginx
```

Nginx access and error logs are automatically forwarded to stdout/stderr and visible via `docker logs`

## Logging

The application logs important events:

- Configuration changes detected
- Certificate scanning results
- Nginx reload success/failure
- Error details with recovery actions

Logs can be viewed with:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Troubleshooting

### Container Stops Immediately

**Cause**: Invalid configuration or missing certificates

**Solution**:

1. Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
2. Verify `configs/config.yaml` exists and is valid YAML
3. Ensure all domains have matching certificates in `ssl/`

### Certificate Not Found

**Cause**: Certificate file naming doesn't match expected patterns

**Solution**:

1. Check certificate files follow naming pattern: `domain.crt/key` or `domain_bundle.crt/key`
2. Ensure both `.crt` and `.key` files exist
3. Check logs for certificate scanning results

### Nginx Fails to Reload

**Cause**: Configuration error or certificate issues

**Solution**:

1. Application automatically rolls back to last working configuration
2. Check logs for specific error messages
3. Fix the configuration or certificate issue
4. Changes will be automatically detected and reloaded
